# Symbolic Link Creation Instructions (if your cadwork API directory is not in the same directory as your Python scripts)

This explains how to create a symbolic link from a directory (in my case `Debug`) to the cadwork API directory (
`D:\cadwork\userprofil_2025\3d\API.x64`).

## Why create a symbolic link?

Creating a symbolic link allows you to develop Python scripts in this directory while making them directly accessible
in the cadwork API directory without duplicating files.

## Instructions

Using Command Prompt (Administrator)
Press `Win + X` and select "Command Prompt (Admin)"
Run the following command:

```bash
mklink /D "D:\cadwork\userprofil_2025\3d\API.x64\Debug" "D:\source\Python\Debug"
```

```bash
C:\Users\MichaelBrunner>mklink /D "D:\cadwork\userprofil_2025\3d\API.x64\Debug" "D:\source\Python\Debug"
symbolic link created for D:\cadwork\userprofil_2025\3d\API.x64\Debug <<===>> D:\source\Python\Debug
```

Using PowerShell (Administrator)
Press `Win + X` and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)"
Run the following command:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "D:\cadwork\userprofil_2025\3d\API.x64\Debug" -Target "D:\source\Python\Debug"
```

## Verifying the link

After creating the symbolic link, any file placed in this directory will be accessible from the cadwork API directory,
and vice versa.

## Removing the link

If you need to remove the symbolic link:

```bash
rmdir "D:\cadwork\userprofil_2025\3d\API.x64\Debug"
```

# PyQt (for building GUI's)

PyQt is a set of Python bindings for The Qt Companyâ€™s Qt application framework.
PyQt is available in cadwork, so you don't need to install it separately for running the scripts.
You have to install it for the development process.

```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

[Python and PyQt: Building a GUI Desktop Calculator](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/)

Create the UI file using Qt Designer and convert it to Python code using the `pyuic5` command.

```bash
pyuic5 debug_dialog.ui -o ui_debug_dialog.py
```
